# Cast to and from the underlying type

It is recommended not to use casting operators, either explicit or implicit.

It might seem like a handy way to use the underlying primitive natively, but the goal of strong-typing primitives is to differentiate them from the underlying type.

Take, for instance, a `Score` type:

```c#
[ValueObject<int>]
public partial struct Score { }
```

A cast operator, whether implicit or explicit would allow easy access to the `Value`, allowing things such as
`int n = _score + 10;`. But what would be preferable is to be explicit and add a method that describes the operation, 
something like:

```c#
[ValueObject<int>]
public partial struct Score 
{ 
    public Score IncreaseBy(Points points) => From(_value + points.Value);
}
```
