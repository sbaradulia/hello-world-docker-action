<card-summary>
How to create and use Value Objects, how they better represent domain concepts, and how they help ensure
that no invalid instances can be created.

Create a new Value Object by decorating a partial type with the `ValueObject` attribute:

```c#
[ValueObject<int>] 
public partial struct CustomerId { }
```

The type must be `partial` as the source generator augments the type with another partial class containing the
generator code.

Now, create a new instance by using the `From` method:

```c#
var customerId = CustomerId.From(42);
```

If you try to use the constructors, the [analyzer rules](Analyzer-Rules.md) will catch this and stop you.

You can now be more explicit in your methods with signatures such as:

```c#
public void HandlePayment(
    CustomerId customerId, 
    AccountId accountId, 
    PaymentAmount paymentAmount)
```
